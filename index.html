      <p>
        My name is Sierra Seetin. I am currently in my first year at Wheaton College Massachusetts pursuing a double major in Film and Business. I am originally from Queens, New York. I love tech, movies and making things and I aspire to merge these together during my time in Fab Academy. Ever since I was young I've loved systems of sorts—from Rube Goldberg machines, Minecraft redstone, to 3D printing—I like using machines to make my life easier.
